# Falling ship
This is a flappy bird like game done with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

 Nothing else to say about it, same spirit than the source material but with diferent assets. Therefore, this is a great game to make if you want to learn the basic of a new game engine (imo). So this is what I did to learn Godot.
